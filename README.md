Python Fundamentals Project Overview
This project demonstrates core Python concepts through practical tasks involving lists, dictionaries, sets, and conditional logic. Itâ€™s designed to reinforce foundational skills and prepare learners for real-world applications in data handling and decision-making.

ðŸ“Œ Functional Highlights
ðŸ”¹ List Operations
â€¢ 	Add a new name to a list of names.
â€¢ 	Insert an age value at a specific position in a list of ages.
â€¢ 	Remove a specific name from the list.
â€¢ 	Remove the last age from the list.
â€¢ 	Add multiple new ages to the existing list.
â€¢ 	Sort the age list in reverse order (highest to lowest).
â€¢ 	Identify the maximum, minimum, and total of all age values.
ðŸ”¹ Accessing List Elements
â€¢ 	Retrieve the first and last names from the list.
â€¢ 	Display a subset of names based on position range.
â€¢ 	Reverse the order of names in the list.

ðŸ”¹ Dictionary Operations
â€¢ 	Create a dictionary mapping student names to their marks.
â€¢ 	Retrieve the mark of a specific student.
â€¢ 	Add a new student with their mark.
â€¢ 	Update the mark of an existing student.
â€¢ 	Display all student names, all marks, and all name-mark pairs.

ðŸ”¹ Set Operations
â€¢ 	Create a set from a list of vowels with duplicates.
â€¢ 	Observe how duplicates are automatically removed.
â€¢ 	Attempt to modify a set element by position and understand why it fails.
â€¢ 	Create two sets of numbers and compute:
â€¢ 	Their union (all unique elements)
â€¢ 	Their intersection (common elements)

ðŸ”¹ Conditional Logic: Performance Evaluation
â€¢ 	Accept a score input from the user within a defined range.
â€¢ 	Categorize the score as:
â€¢ 	Above Average
â€¢ 	Average
â€¢ 	Below Average
â€¢ 	Display a motivational message based on the category.

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
â€¢ 	Understand how Python handles data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets.
â€¢ 	Practice input validation and user interaction.
â€¢ 	Apply conditional logic to real-world scenarios.
â€¢ 	Gain confidence in manipulating and accessing structured data.
